## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [FormSpree](https://formspree.io) - A third party Form service to handle form submissions.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [ViteJs](https://styled-components.com/) - A very fast dev tool to launch light project.

### What I learned

- I learnt about form submissions using a third-party form service. It was very productive going through their documentation.

- I had an opportunity to recap on `positioning` , `::before` and `::after` pseudo elements.

- Got more acquitted with styled-components.

### Continued development

- As I further my skills with react, I am happy with my continuous development with it and on the way learning more about react library styled components, react-forms just to mention but a few.
